# A simple, half working, chess + four in a row combination

Compile and run by running `cabal run`, then click "play as both" you now first move as chess, using basic chess rules.
After this it is the "Four in a row" player's turn, they can place a tile in the top row. 
The chess player wins if there is no four in a row in 15 turns, the four in a row player wins if they get four tiles in a row.

No AI implemented as I ran out of motivation for this project, so the code is also still quite messy :)
